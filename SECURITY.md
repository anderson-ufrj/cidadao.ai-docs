# üîí Security Policy - Cidad√£o.AI Documentation Hub

## üìã Overview

This document outlines the security practices and vulnerability disclosure process for the Cidad√£o.AI Documentation Hub website.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x     | :x:                |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Static Site Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **Secure Headers**: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All content served over HTTPS
- **No Server-side Processing**: Static HTML/CSS/JS reduces attack surface
- **GitHub Pages Security**: Leveraging GitHub's security infrastructure

### Content Protection
- **Input Sanitization**: All user-generated content sanitized
- **XSS Prevention**: Proper escaping of dynamic content
- **No Sensitive Data**: Documentation contains only public information
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies and frameworks kept current

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report
1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to: **security@cidadao.ai** (or andersonhs27@gmail.com)
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected pages or components
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: 1-5 days
- **Fix Development**: 1-7 days
- **Deployment**: Within 24 hours of fix completion
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Content Security
- All external links reviewed for safety
- No execution of user-provided JavaScript
- Regular review of included third-party libraries
- Monitoring for defaced or malicious content

### Development Security
```bash
# Security checks for development
npm audit                    # Check for vulnerable dependencies
htmlhint *.html             # Validate HTML for security issues
```

### Deployment Security
- **GitHub Pages**: Secure hosting platform
- **HTTPS Only**: SSL/TLS encryption enforced
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch protected from direct pushes
- **Review Required**: All changes require review before deployment

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automatic vulnerability detection
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **Link Checker**: Regular validation of external links
- **Content Integrity**: Monitoring for unauthorized changes

### Manual Reviews
- Quarterly security review of all content
- Regular audit of third-party dependencies
- Review of access logs (via GitHub Analytics)
- Testing of all interactive features

## üìä Privacy Considerations

### Data Collection
- **Analytics**: Minimal, privacy-focused analytics only
- **No Personal Data**: Site doesn't collect personal information
- **No Cookies**: No tracking or session cookies
